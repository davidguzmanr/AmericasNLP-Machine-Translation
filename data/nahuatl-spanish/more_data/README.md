## Resources

- The Bible comes from here [Nahuatl (Guerrero)](https://live.bible.is/bible/NGUTBL/MAT/1) and [Spanish](https://live.bible.is/bible/SPNNVI/MAT/1).
- There are some stories in Spanish-Nahuatl here [Libros en lenguas ind√≠genas](https://www.gob.mx/inpi/documentos/libros-en-lenguas-indigenas).
- The Constitution comes from here [Nahuatl](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/37182/constitucion_politca_estados_unidos_mexicanos_nahuatl.pdf) and [Spanish](https://www.seguridadbc.gob.mx/Planeacion/marcolegalPDF/1.pdf).

## Observations
- The different variants are very different, for instance, the 3 different variants from Puebla differ a lot from each other. According to Shuo Puebla has 2 main variants, one which is very similar to Central Nahuatl. Guerrero also has some variants similar to Central Nahuatl. 
- The stories come from different places, so we have to pick the ones that are closer to the variant we have.
- The language from the Constitution is very specific, so I think it won't be useful.
